-- One-shot import of the v1 dataset, which lives in this same Supabase project.
-- v1 kept its data in `residency_applications` + `admin_comments`; both are left
-- untouched and serve as the archive. Row ids carry over, so re-running is a no-op.
--
-- Two generations of the v1 form are mixed in the source. The later one asked
-- bio / proposed_contribution / telegram / country separately; the earlier one only
-- had a combined about_and_contribution plus a free-text contact_info. Each coalesce
-- chain below takes the most specific answer available and falls back to the combined
-- one, so early rows end up with the same text in both `about` and `contribution`.
--
-- Fields v1 collected that v2 has no column for are preserved as one review note per
-- application rather than dropped. Everything else in the source table is empty across
-- all rows and carries nothing.
